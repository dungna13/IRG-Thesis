PLEASE READ: INSTRUCTIONS TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB
==============================================

Since I cannot directly access your GitHub credentials or web browser to push the code for you, you need to execute the following commands in your terminal to upload this project.

1.  Open your Terminal (PowerShell or Git Bash).
2.  Navigate to the project folder:
    cd "c:\Users\Admin\OneDrive\Máy tính\code\GraduationThesis"

3.  Initialize Git:
    git init

4.  Add all files:
    git add .

5.  Commit the files:
    git commit -m "Initial commit of Graduation Thesis: Qwen-IRG Project"

6.  Create a new repository on GitHub:
    *   Go to https://github.com/new
    *   Name it (e.g., "Qwen-IRG-Thesis").
    *   Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one).
    *   Click "Create repository".

7.  Link your local repository to GitHub:
    (Replace <YOUR-USERNAME> with your actual GitHub username and <REPO-NAME> with the name you chose)

    git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<REPO-NAME>.git

8.  Push the code:
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main

Once done, your project and the professional README will be live on GitHub.
